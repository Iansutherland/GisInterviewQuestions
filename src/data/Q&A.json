        "question": "GIS specialists should have a variety of hard and soft skills to do their work well. The hiring manager might ask you which skills you deem most important to see what you value in your work and if those skills align with the companys goals.",
        "Example": "GIS specialists should have a variety of skills, but the most important ones, in my opinion, are patience, technical problem-solving and communication. Patience is important because it takes time to acquire and review the data before building the map. Technical problem-solving because the information might be gathered or represented using different programs and communication because explaining GIS to non-GIS colleagues is necessary."

        "question": "Explain the difference between geo-coding and geo-referencing.",
        "Example": "While geo-coding and geo-referencing are similar, they have a key distinction. Geocoding is the process of taking written data, like the name of a place or an address, and assigning coordinates on a map to that information. Geo-referencing is the process of taking a satellite image and assigning map coordinates to it. The result is the same (the coordinate assignment), but the process of arriving at that result differs."

        "question": "How does GPS support GIS?",
        "Example": "GPS and GIS are interrelated. GPS collects data from satellites to help people determine their specific location. GIS uses the information collected via GPS and organizes it in a functional, understandable manner."

    "15": {
        "question": "Explain what GIS is to a fifth-grader.",
        "Example": "GIS is a complex field and can take some time to understand. GIS takes geographical data, like coordinates and addresses, and finds patterns and trends within that data. GIS specialists use those trends to create visualizations and find solutions to problems for companies and businesses."
